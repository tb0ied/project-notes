##About me

My name is Patryk,
I love outdoor sports and photography. Exploring nature and capturing its beauty through my lens is my passion. Whether it's hiking, cycling, or just strolling in the woods, I find joy in every moment spent outdoors. My camera is my faithful companion on these adventures, helping me freeze those breathtaking moments in time. Nature enthusiast and photographer at heart, that's me!
